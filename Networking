Networking is the process of connecting two or more computers or devices so they can communicate and share data, resources, and services.
1. IP Address (Internet Protocol)

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to a device on a network.
It helps identify where a device is located in a network.

Cyber Security relevance: Used in tracking attackers, configuring firewalls, and detecting suspicious traffic.

2. MAC Address (Media Access Control)

A MAC address is a unique hardware address assigned to a network interface card (NIC).
Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Cyber Security relevance: Used in device identification; can be spoofed in attacks.

3. DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
Acts like the phonebook of the internet.

Cyber Security relevance: Target of attacks like DNS spoofing, DNS poisoning, and phishing.

4. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

A connection-oriented protocol.
Ensures reliable data transfer with error checking and sequencing.
Used by: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP

Cyber Security relevance: Exploited in attacks like TCP SYN flood.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

A connectionless protocol.
Faster but less reliable (no error checking).
Used by: DNS, VoIP, video streaming, online games

Cyber Security relevance: Used in UDP flood attacks and amplification attacks.
