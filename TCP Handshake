Three-Way TCP Handshake

The three-way TCP handshake is the process used by TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server before data transfer begins.
Steps of the TCP Handshake
1️. SYN (Synchronize)

The client sends a SYN packet to the server.

Purpose: Request to start a connection

2. SYN-ACK (Synchronize + Acknowledgment)

The server responds with SYN + ACK.
Purpose:
Acknowledge client’s request
Send server’s own sequence number

3. ACK (Acknowledgment)

The client sends an ACK packet.
Purpose: Confirm connection establishment

Logical View :
Client                     Server
  | ------ SYN ----------> |
  | <--- SYN + ACK ------- |
  | ------ ACK ----------> |
        Connection Established


-> Identify plain-text traffic vs encrypted traffic


      Plain-Text Traffic                Encrypted Traffic     

 Data is readable                    Data is unreadable           
 No encryption used                  Encryption (TLS/SSL) used    
  Low security                        High security                
  Anyone can sniff data              Sniffed data is protected    
  Example: HTTP, FTP, Telnet          Example: HTTPS, SSH, SFTP
